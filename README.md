               Minecraft Chat Plugin
```
     
## Info
Strings is a Chat plugin focusing on channels, text styling, auto broadcasts, with Placeholder API and Vault support. 

The biggest focus with this plugin is channels.  As of writing, there are 3 main types of channels.

 - StringChannel (Server wide)
 - World 
 - Proximity

These channels all function in slightly different ways, and detailed information will be posted on the wiki.  
## API
I'm working on a developer API, and more information will follow soon.
